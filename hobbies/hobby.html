<!-- Pictures and Description -->
<div id="pictures">
  <h3>Makeup is Me</h3>
  <p id="description"> I wanted to show Hazel's love for makeup and how it is a part of her identity.</p>

  <h3>In My Room</h3>
  <p id="description"> She was so excited when she got LED lights for her room so I wanted to capture Hazel in her element at home.</p>

  <h3> Pyramid to Me</h3>
  <p id="description"> Since Hazel lives on Lakeshore, she walks past this dock everyday. I found the way the lines met at her head 
    very intriguing.</p>

  <h3> In the Trees</h3>
  <p id="description">While we were sitting on a bench on Lakeshore, I loved the way the tree lined up with her and the way the 
    sunlight hit Hazel's face. </p>

  <h3> Lakeside</h3>
  <p id="description"> UW-Madison is known for our iconic lake right on campus so I wanted to incorporate it into my photos. </p>

  <h3> The Leaves and the Sun</h3>
  <p id="description"> I loved how the light was coming through the green leaves so I wanted to capture a photo of Hazelal
    camoflauged into the trees. </p>
